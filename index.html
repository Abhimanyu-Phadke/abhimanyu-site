  <p>I am a lawyer by training. After graduating from national law school, I began my career in the high-stakes world of big law, first at Khaitan & Co., and then at a boutique tech law firm. I worked closely with founders, product teams, and investors on everything from commercial negotiations to product advisory. It was intense, fast-paced, and high pressure (as one would expect in a tier 1 law firm) — but over time, I started to feel like I was solving the wrong part of the puzzle.</p>

  <p>So I jumped into the chaos of a YC-backed fintech startup, FamPay. While my title said “legal,” the work went far beyond that. I was embedded within the strategy team as well, and in a Series A environment, that meant doing whatever it took to put out fires, from leading the regulatory audits and transitions to helping define how our credit products would work in-market. That’s where I learnt something law schools don’t teach — real strategic advice doesn’t just manage risk, it moves the needle. Being useful meant not just knowing the rules, but knowing when to navigate or reframe them to help the business win.</p>

  <p>Now at Google, I work as Product Counsel, operating at the intersection of regulation, product, and strategy. I advise on product structures and help shape strategy where legal, business, and user experience collide. It's a very different scale, but the same instincts apply: make decisions without perfect data, manage trade-offs, and move things forward.</p>

  <p>I’ve worked in both zero-to-one and global-scale settings, and I’ve realised I thrive in spaces where execution is just as important as thinking clearly. The next chapter, for me, is about being closer to the problem, not only helping shape what gets built, but also how it gets done.</p>
