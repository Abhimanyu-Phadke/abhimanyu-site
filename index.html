        <p>I am a lawyer by training. After graduating from national law school, I started out in the big law circuit — first at Khaitan & Co., then at a boutique tech law firm. The work was fast-paced and high-stakes (as one would expect in a tier 1 law firm), but I often felt like I was on the outside looking in, negotiating contracts and structuring products for businesses I would rather help shape.</p>
        <p>So I jumped into the chaos of a YC-backed fintech startup, FamPay. While my title said “legal,” the work was anything but. I was embedded within the strategy team, and in a Series A environment, that meant doing whatever it took to put out fires — from structuring credit products to helping the company transition from a banking partner to its own licensed entity — a move that could’ve cost us our entire customer base if not handled right. That’s where I learnt something law schools don’t teach...</p>
        <p>Now, at Google, as Product Counsel, I’ve continued to straddle law, strategy and business (at a much larger scale) — from advising on product structures to helping shape the company’s UPI international strategy. It’s pushed me to operate in high-complexity environments, align across global teams, and make decisions where regulation, product, and market strategy collide.</p>
        <p>The next chapter, for me, is about being closer to the problem — not only helping shape what gets built, but also how it gets done.</p>
