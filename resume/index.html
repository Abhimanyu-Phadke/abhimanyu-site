          <p class="company-desc"><em>Global technology company helping billions of users make sense of the world.</em></p>
          <p>I work at the intersection of product, regulation, and strategy, partnering with cross-functional teams across GPay and Ads, to help shape product structures, navigate legal and regulatory ambiguity, and help shape what gets launched — where, how, and in what form, based on regulatory fit and product trade-offs.</p>

          <h4>Associate | 2023–Present</h4>
          <p class="company-desc"><em>Boutique tech law firm advising high-growth startups and global tech clients.</em></p>
          <p>I advise clients across tech sectors like fintech, consumer, gaming — helping them launch, structure, and scale products in heavily regulated sectors. My work spanned everything from regulatory advisory to commercial negotiation and licensing.</p>

          <p>          <p>I joined early and worked closely with the founders and strategy team during a phase of fast experimentation and regulatory change. My role extended beyond legal — from supporting our transition to a licensed entity, to defining how our credit and wallet products could work in-market. I sat with product, design, finance and marketing team and did what was needed to move the business forward.</p>

          <p>I worked on a range of investment, regulatory, and commercial matters. It was my first real taste of working across industries, deal timelines, and high-stakes negotiations.
